# Web Stack Outage Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:**  
  - Start Time: March 22, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC  
  - End Time: March 22, 2024, 1:00 PM UTC
- **Impact:**  
  - Service Affected: Web Application
  - Users experienced complete service unavailability and slow response times.
  - Approximately 80% of our user base was affected, unable to access the platform during the outage.
- **Root Cause:**  
  - The outage was caused by a sudden surge in traffic, overwhelming our servers and leading to database overload. Insufficient monitoring systems further exacerbated the situation, delaying our response efforts.

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM UTC:** Issue Detected  
  - Our monitoring systems triggered alerts due to a sudden spike in traffic to the web application.
- **10:15 AM UTC:** Actions Taken  
  - Engineers began investigating the issue, focusing on database performance and server health.
  - Initial assumption: Database overload due to increased traffic.
- **10:30 AM UTC:** Misleading Investigation Paths  
  - Some initial focus on network connectivity issues led to temporary diversion from the root cause.
  - Assumed possible DDoS attack due to the rapid influx of traffic.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Escalation  
  - Incident escalated to senior engineering team and management for additional resources and expertise.
- **12:00 PM UTC:** Resolution  
  - Database optimizations implemented to alleviate overload.
  - Auto-scaling configurations adjusted to handle increased traffic more efficiently.
  - Communication channels activated to update users on the progress of the resolution efforts.
- **1:00 PM UTC:** Issue Resolved  
  - Services fully restored, and traffic stabilized to normal levels.
  - Post-incident analysis initiated to identify areas for improvement and prevent future occurrences.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:**
  - The primary cause of the web stack outage was a sudden and unexpected surge in traffic to our platform. This surge overwhelmed our servers, leading to database overload and subsequent service unavailability.
- **Resolution:**
  - To address the issue, several measures were implemented, including database optimization, infrastructure scaling, monitoring enhancements, and improved communication strategies. These efforts collectively improved the reliability and resilience of our web stack.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Areas for Improvement/Fixes:**
  1. Scalability
  2. Monitoring
  3. Database Optimization
  4. Communication
  5. Training
- **Specific Tasks:**
  1. Implement Auto-Scaling
  2. Enhance Monitoring Systems
  3. Database Optimization
  4. Communication Improvements
  5. Training Sessions
- **TODO List:**
  1. Patch Nginx server to the latest version
  2. Install monitoring agents on all servers
  3. Set up automated backups for the database
  4. Conduct load testing exercises regularly
  5. Review and update incident response documentation
